      <h3>CH- 1 Coping Life</h3>
      <p>As a writer, I have written many unfinished stories and random thoughts, which I have either recorded in notes, highlights, or an online journal. Those unfinished ones had a bit more purpose compared to the others, yet my biggest regret is that I lost the most important piece of writing. The saddest part is that it was selected by a publishing company, and they told me to turn it into a full story for publication. Unfortunately, I wasn't prepared for the story yet and thought I would complete it soon, but as days and months passed due to classes, I ended up realizing that I had actually lost the writing I originally submitted to them. Well, what's done is done. The regret is not just about losing it, but that I couldn't remember what I wrote. I tried my best to recall it but couldn't. Fortunately, as I was going through my random writing notes, I found the background of the story I had written. So I thought, why not polish it and write it down as a short memoir?
This is happening now, in a dark, empty place. The person suddenly feels lonely and starts looking for light or someone to help.
He has mixed feelings - both hope and despair - which is why he writes: "I'm alone and I love you."
He believes someone out there loves him, but deep down, he knows he's completely alone. He's scared, yet he feels a strange warmth in the darkness.
Then, a light appears, and he feels happy, thinking he can finally leave. Someone comes with the light.
He tries to reach them, but can't. The person says: "You can leave this place, but you will come back."
Why? Because this person knows him better than anyone else - it's his future self. His future self knows he's safer here alone than with others.
So why does he still want to leave if he feels warmth here? Because that's who he is: when he first felt lonely, he tried hard to connect with people, but eventually grew tired and gave up.
After stopping, he felt relief - he could finally be himself without pretending.
It's like moving to a new house after years: at first, you feel sad and miss your old memories. But with time, you make new memories and grow to love the new place, forgetting parts of the old one.
The story behind the writing makes it seem like many of the pieces are broken. The thing is, the explanation behind the story was written a long time ago, and I just wrote it in short form at the time. I tried to polish it, yet it feels like something's missing. So I think I'll just give a proper explanation. Basically, I wrote a poem where the character was experiencing depersonalization, avoidant personality, schizoid traits, and maladaptive coping mechanisms.
I'll break it down for what it all means:
* Depersonalization means the person feels like they are watching themselves from outside their own body, like seeing themselves from far away, like in a dream. Basically, it's getting disconnected from reality and thoughts.
* Avoidant Personality Disorder is when you feel very sensitive to rejection or criticism from others. Because of this, the person tries to avoid social interaction even though they need someone.
* Schizoid is when the person prefers to be alone even though they have many close relationships. This person becomes completely detached emotionally from others.
* Maladaptive Coping Mechanisms are when a person tries to deal with stress in ways that don't help and actually make things worse.
The poem itself was kind of manipulative with these words because the moment people read it, they would just say "depression." The idea was that people often see someone going through these situations and quickly label them as "mentally unstable" or just call them a "depressed person." What people don't understand is that what we label them as isn't anything close to how they actually feel.
Anyway, I'm not any sort of professional who can speak on this topic; I just wrote a poem based on it. Unfortunately, I don't have it anymore, but at least I have a small gist of it for those who are interested in reading.</p>

      <h3>CH- 2 A Legend</h3>
      <p>Mahmoud Darwish is such a legend who uses few words to express my entire range of emotions. As a writer, it is difficult to convey emotions effectively while also making readers visualize the scenario in their minds as they read. 
As a kid, I always loved telling stories and altering the stories that were already written by actual authors. Whenever something comes up, I love to write it down, but the biggest obstacle for me was "finishing" the process. An actual writer always finishes writing before putting the pen down, but I always keep the pen down in the middle of the story.

I wasn’t fighting to give an end to the stories that I had in mind; instead, I was fighting with myself over self-doubt and maybe trying to come up with different endings to figure out what the "perfect ending" was.

I’m not expecting to be a great author or even want to be a simple amateur author. All I loved about stories as a kid was how we could make a story magical or terrifying. There was a movie called 999 (which is related to dam that breaks and floods). I think it was released before I was even born. I don’t know the story or anything related to it, but because someone talked about it when I was in 2nd grade, I created my own version and changed the outcome to a funny one by writing, "The water that came after the dam broke was completely dried out because one of the helpers who was saving people from the flood drank all the water when he fell in. Which is why he was in the toilet for the entire day. "

I know it might sound silly, but as a kid, I never thought about how people would react to my story. It was all about playing and having fun with words.

I think when it comes to writing/telling stories or listening to others share theirs, it was very addictive for me. If someone could keep yapping with lots of stories, I would sit the whole time with the same interest. And if no one had stories to tell, then I would start sharing new ones. If someone didn't pay attention to my stories for even a second, that used to bother me. It would upset me a lot, making me wonder if my story was bad. I was the type of kid who was really stubborn when it came to wanting to hear more stories.

I preferred listening because when anyone told me a story, I loved how they visualized it.

Obviously, not everyone can feed me thousands of stories at a time, and that’s how I came to love cartoons. Kid’s around my time used to enjoy rhymes and brightly colored cartoons, but I wasn’t one of them. I preferred stories that made me feel like they had a truly fun plot. Fun plots- completely different from reality, allowed me to see the world of imagination. One of the cartoons that stands out in my mind was a little boy who was lost at sea. He could breathe underwater and talk with fishes. He was a human who could walk and talk to other humans. But what intrigued me was how he could breathe in water without any special powers. How he could even talk to the fishes when all I saw of actual fishes was them just staring at us or other fishes. Even though I never got answers to these questions as a kid, I still enjoyed it because the whole point of the story was to have fun with words and plot.</p>
